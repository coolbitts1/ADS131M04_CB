# ADS1220_WE

This is an Arduino library for the 24-bit, 4 channel ADS1220 ADC. I have tried to make it convenient and easy to use. All features of the ADS1220 have been implemented. The examples should help to understand how to use the functions.

If you like the library, it would be great if you could give a star. If you find bugs, please inform me.

In some weeks I will publish a tutorial on my website:
